# Polarized-Glasses-for-Photosensitive-Epilepsy
Designed polarized glasses using servo controller, polarizing filters, Arduino, gears, and phototransistor to detect and block flashing lights between a certain frequency range to protect against detrimental health effects experienced by users with photosensitive epilepsy when exposed to flickering lights.

----------------------------------
Photosensitive epilepsy is a neurological condition which affects millions of people globally with one of the main symptoms being sensitivity to flashing lights. The frequency or speed of the flashing lights can provoke various health conditions such as epilepsy, flickering vertigo,vestibular migraines, meniereâ€™s disease, and much more.
